# dailydrinks

At 17 Media, we love handmade drinks. Sometimes we just go out and buy from the store nearby, sometimes we order ourselves by filling out a form and call for delivery.

Please build an web app named `dailydrinks` which has the following features.

- [ ]  Homepage is a list to list all the `orders`
- [ ]  Each `order` contains the following fields:
    1. A single-line text of it's `name`
    2. The number `price` of the order
    3. A multi-line **optional** text to specify additional `notes`
- [ ]  One can **add** a new order to the list by filling out a form somewhere in your app
- [ ]  One can **delete** any order in the list
- [ ]  One can also **edit** any order in the list

## Notes

1. You can use any JavaScript framework (or plain vanilla JavaScript) you like, feel free to choose whatever you are most familiar with. But since we mostly use **React** at work, prefer using it if you are confident with it.
2. Starter-kit like `create-react-app` or `vue-cli` are allowed and actually encouraged, we don't want to waste any of your precious time setting up environment.
3. Please avoid using CSS frameworks too heavily, we want to see how you build your app from scratch, and how your CSS skills are. However for some cases it's reasonable to style a portion of your app with pre-defined style. Inevitably, we will be somewhat subjective about this, but you are more than welcome to discuss the thoughts behind the choice you make. 
4. You are free to use any npm packages out there you like, but just like CSS frameworks, only use them when it makes sense and use them with caution. Again, we are going to be somewhat subjective, welcome to describe your intention.
5. The style and any additional features or details not specified in the above requirements are completely free to play with. You don't have to make the UI very beautiful but at least it should be well-organized.
6. Your app normally will be run entirely on desktop, but if your app supports RWD, you should mention it in README.
7. Pay attention to basic accessibility and user experience, make your app easy to use for normal users.
8. Make sure your app runs in the last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, and macOS Safari.
9. The app should be fully functional without any back-end server or database, you can just store your state in memory.
10. Keep your source code clean, organized and modularized, we will be reviewing them.
11. Testing are bonus and are not required.
12. Keep security, performance, maintainability, and scalability in mind, develop your app as a minimal product, think about what users want. We will be working a lot with product team, attention to detail can help us work smoother.
13. You don't have to make your app super complete or fully-featured. The time we estimiated is 2 hours, you can spend more or less, but please don't spend too much time on it, it will only be a reference for the next phase of the interview process.
14. Upload your app to (Or just code entirely on) [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) when done, make sure your app behaves normally in the preview too. Alternatively if your app for some reason cannot run on it, you can push your app to [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). Please make sure to set up permission setting to let us view your project.
15. Create a file under the root directory called `README.md`, briefly describe your application and, if you've implemented any additional features, a detailed but simple description about how to use them. Documenting is also a very important skill we value.
16. Send us back an email along with the link of your application via reply. Once you've submitted the code, please don't update it afterwards. If for some reason the app breaks because of it, we won't be able to identify the cause.
